FILE: instaScraper.py.  
Scraper to extract post information from an Instagram public page and output a CSV.

No authentification required. Use with caution, respect others' IP...
Sample params.json file:  
{
    "user": "yourpage",  
    "user_id": "uniqueid",  
    "query_hash": "ADD QUERY HASH HERE"  
}
